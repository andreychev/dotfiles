# GNU command line tools
#
# If you are moving onto macOS from GNU/Linux, then you would probably
# find out that the command line tools shipped with macOS are not as
# powerful and easy to use as the tools in Linux. The reason is that
# macOS uses the BSD version command line tools, which are different
# from the Linux version.
#
# Note: if you choose to replace the macOS commands with GNU commands,
# then be aware that you may have some compatibility issues with shell
# scripts written specifically for macOS.
#
# If you like using man pages, then you may also want to add an
# itemto the to the MANPATH environmental variable:
#
#     $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman
#
